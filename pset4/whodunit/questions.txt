1.  What’s stdint.h?

    This file contain definitions of several signed and unsigned integer types.

2.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?

    They are used to describe aliases for primitive data types.

3.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?

    BYTE is 8, WORD is 16, DWORD and LONG are 32 bytes respectively.

4.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? 
    Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called 
    "magic numbers."

    The first 2 bytes of the BMP file format are the characters "B" and "M" in ASCII encoding, 
    0x42 0x4D in hexadecimal and 66 77 in decimal encoding respectively.

5.  What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?

    bfSize is equal to size, in bytes, of the bitmap file, and biSize is the number of bytes 
    required by the structure of BITMAPINFOHEADER.

6.  What does it mean if biHeight is negative?

    If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down device independent bitmap and its origin
    is the upper-left corner.

7.  What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?

    The biBitCount determines the number of bits that define each pixel and the maximum number 
    of colors in the bitmap.

8.  Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?

    Upon  successful  completion  fopen() return a FILE pointer.  Otherwise, NULL is
    returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

9.  Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?

    In our case this means to read data in one data structure.

10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?

    padding = (4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4 =
    = (4 - (3 * 3) % 4) % 4 = (4 - 1) % 4 = 3

11. What does fseek do?

    The fseek() function skip over padding by adding padding bytes to the position 
    specified by SEEK_CUR.

12. What is SEEK_CUR?

    SEEK_CUR is the current position indicator in the file.
